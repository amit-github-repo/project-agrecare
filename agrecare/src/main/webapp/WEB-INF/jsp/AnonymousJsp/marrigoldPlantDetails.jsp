Blooms naturally occur in golden, orange, yellow, and white colors, often with maroon highlights. Floral heads are typically 4-6 cm diameter, generally with both ray florets and disc florets. In horticulture, they tend to be planted as annuals, although the perennial species are gaining popularity. They have fibrous roots.Depending on the species, Marrigold species grow well in almost any sort of soil. Most horticultural selections grow best in soil with good drainage, and some cultivars are known to have good tolerance to drought.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Marigolds, both French and African, are indigenous to Mexico and Guatemala. They were discovered in the early 16th century and brought to Europe and Northern Africa in the late 16th century where they were quickly adopted into gardens. The family name, Tagetes, is derived from a mythical Etruscan deity.Queen Sophia is an older French Marigold with fully double flower in gold and maroon that was introduced in the early 1900's. Jolly Jester harkens back to the original wild French marigolds which had single, daisy-like flowers. Sparky was the result of an intensive breeding program initiated in the mid-20th century which produced several fine double French marigolds.</p>
